# HYDRO CLEAN VISIONâ€“ Object Detection for Underwater Waste Solutions


Hydro Clean Vision is a solution designed to tackle underwater pollution using advanced object detection technologies. It employs AI-driven computer vision to identify, classify, and locate underwater waste, enabling effective monitoring and cleanup of water bodies


### **Key Features:**
1. **Object Detection Algorithms:**  
   Utilizes deep learning models (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN) to detect and recognize various types of underwater waste like plastics, metals, and organic debris.

2. **Underwater Imaging:**  
   Integrates underwater cameras (ROV or drone-based) to capture high-resolution visuals even in murky water conditions.

3. **AI and Machine Learning:**  
   Trains models to differentiate between waste and natural underwater elements like fish or vegetation, improving detection accuracy.

4. **Real-time Monitoring:**  
   Provides live feeds with real-time analytics, enabling instant detection and localization of waste for cleanup.

5. **IoT Integration:**  
   Combines IoT devices for data collection and environmental parameter monitoring, like water quality, pH levels, and turbidity.

### **Applications:**
- Cleanup of rivers, lakes, and oceans.
- Supporting waste management initiatives in water bodies.
- Assisting environmental agencies in marine ecosystem conservation.
- Enhancing sustainable underwater resource management.

### **Benefits:**
- **Efficiency:** Automates the detection of underwater pollutants, reducing manual effort.  
- **Scalability:** Can be deployed across multiple water bodies simultaneously.  
- **Precision:** Minimizes false positives with advanced AI models.  
- **Environmental Impact:** Contributes to cleaner aquatic ecosystems and protects marine life.
